            Projects are done to solve a problem, satisfy a need, comply with a legal requirement or capitalize on/exploit an opportunity.  These are often the business reasons for undertaking projects and are outlined in the business objectives.   In each case an analysis has to be done.
            Re problems– there is the need to differentiate between symptoms of the problem and causes of the problem.  It is only when the causes are found, that there can be a resolution of the problem.  The reasons for undertaking projects therefore have to do with addressing the causes of the problem.

            Re needs – In an environment of scarcity, especially of finances, there is the need to differentiate between needs and wants and so attack critical issues.   For example, a person wanting to obtain family housing may not qualify for a mortgage but the need for housing can still be filled by way of rental.  However, if the need was really for acquisition of capital assets, then only purchase of the house will suffice.

            Re opportunities:  Properly define the opportunity and clinically examine whether you or your organization are truly in a position to successfully exploit the opportunity.

            Re Legal requirement-.  In this case there is no consideration of whether the project should be done or not.  It has to be done.  You have to determine what the legislation requires you to do and seek to do it in the most cost effective and efficient way.

            It is important to be aware of the above so that you can keep your eyes on the objective as achievement of it will be how the success of the project will be judged

                Python has become one of the most popular languages. So getting only the theoretical knowledge will be of no use unless and until you don’t work on some real-time projects. Working on such projects will test your Python knowledge and you will get some hands-on experience. Moreover, working on such projects will help you improve your knowledge.

            <div class="pinp">Now 10 years in the wild, Google’s Go programming language has certainly made a name for itself. Lightweight and quick to compile, Go has stirred significant interest due to its generous libraries and abstractions that ease the development of concurrent and distributed (read: cloud) applications.

But the true measure of success of any programming language is the projects that developers create with it. Go has proven itself as a first choice for fast development of network services, software infrastructure projects, and compact and powerful tools of all kinds.
